#Ajax Login form
This is a simple login form built with Ajax, PDO and PHP session. jQuery is used for the Ajax requests and Bootstrap is used for styling.

##Database connection and storage
The database connection is built with PDO and assumes that usernames and passwords are stored i separate 'users' and 'passwords' tables under the columns 'name' and 'password' which of course isn't optimal or secure at all. This code is just made for fun. :)
